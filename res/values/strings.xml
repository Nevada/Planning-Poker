    <string name="about_text">Planning Poker is a tool for estimating software development projects. 
        \n\nIt is a consensus-based technique for estimating the development effort in an Agile project. 
        It was first described in 2002 by James Grenning and made popular by Mike Cohn of Mountain Goat Software.
        \n\nThe team usually has a pack of cards for each person to estimate the difficulty of each story and this version was 
developed to replace the cards so that android handsets could be used during planning.
\n\nThis application was written to provide Agile practitioners a tool for planning and estimation without having playing 
cards. It works in the same way as cards in that a number is chosen and displayed on a phone for the team to see.
